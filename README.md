# feli-SH
A tiny comand interpreter in Python

### Actually implemented:

- ls comand, with -a option
- pwd comand
- help comand

  For each comand, <comand> -h or --help can be used to obtain a description of comand usage.

### Usage:

It's recomanded to use python venv to isolate the dependencies ( no one at this moment ). To launch with or without python environment, simply use main.py.
